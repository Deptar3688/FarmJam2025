var tt1 : String = "Welcome to Harvest Magus! \nStart off by selecting the Hoe and tilling some land. You can then plant different seeds on the tilled soil. Be sure to read the tooltips for all plant and tool information. Press the Start Wave button once you have set up your defences."
var tt2 : String = "You must be wondering where everything went. All crops are harvested and sold at the end of the day (I didn't have time for anything fancy). The scythe can be used during the day to sell crops earlier. Some crops have a better cost-to-profit ratio so choose what you plant carefully."
var tt3 : String = "Don't forget to use your spells [only one so far], but keep an eye on your mana. If the built in mana regen is not enough, maybe buy some mana flowers. They suck up mana stright into your veins so fast that you wouldn't even realize. In a more finished game, you'd be able to upgrade the spell between waves."
var tt4 : String = "I had many other ideas for this game that I wish I could've implemented. My original idea for flowers was that they are more of a support crop. They won't be targetted by enemies and they give a lot of utility. The rose bush was supposed to hurt enemies that walked over it."
var tt5 : String = "I also originally planned for waves to come at night as well. The torch lily was supposed to increase the enemies' detection range. However, I didn't get the chance to work on anything related to lighting."
var tt6 : String = "I was also planning on making the game couch co-op-able. Was thinking there could be a raincloud controlled by WASD and SPACE. I played a lot of those types of flash games with my friends and brother. Speaking of, my brother made a lot of the sprites for the game as well and helped fix a lot bugs."
var tt7 : String = "I hope you're having fun. Praying that the balancing isn't too terrible. The extra day was actually a lot of help since I started halfway into the jam and pulled an all nighter to get something playable finished."
var tt8 : String = "I really wish could implement more forest themes. My original idea was like a sort of barrack and you can hire forest heros. Kind of like special agents in BTD5."
var tt9 : String = "I do really like this idea however and I plan on working on it a lot more after this game jam. The scope was definitely a lot larger than I realized and I had to cut out a lot of interesting ideas."
var tt10 : String = "This is the last stage I have planned. You can continue into freeplay mode afterwards if you'd like. Not entirely sure how hard or easy it gets, but good luck. Press the Esc key at any point to head to the game over screen. Anyways, hope you had a good time. Thanks for playing!"
